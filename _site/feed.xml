        <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing everyone has been saying to me for a long time is ‘you should right a blog about this stuff’, so I finally have. This blog will cover all the money saving advice I can think of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first tip I have is to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://pricehare.com&quot;&gt;Pricehare&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did Pricehare come about? Well I’ve been working on it for a long time now, originally it was just a small script I ran to let me know when the price of a chest of draws I wanted dropped. It was from M&amp;amp;S and I know every 6 weeks or so they run a 20% off promotion for furniture. Usually I would just check the website every day, but I thought why should I do it when I can write a script to check for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One year later, a lot of improvements to the original algorithm and we finally have something we think will be useful to other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope it saves you lots of money!&lt;/p&gt;
