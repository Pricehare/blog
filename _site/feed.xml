        <title>How to complain</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Complaining can seem like a daunting task, it needn’t be. If you follow some really simple rules it becomes much easier! Remember if something is not up to your standard then your first port of call is to let the manufacturer know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;research&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you’ve done your research, know your rights who you need to speak to and most importantly what outcome would you like from contacting someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;speak-to-someone&quot;&gt;Speak to someone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always try to speak to someone on the phone, it’s a lot more personal and it normally means you can get something resolved quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-nice&quot;&gt;Be Nice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just &lt;strong&gt;be nice&lt;/strong&gt; no one wants to be shouted it and it’s probably not personally their fault. Try explaining your problem and get the operator to come round to your side of the argument. Explain it slowly and in as much detail as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pick-your-battles&quot;&gt;Pick your battles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some items are not worth complaining about, some really are. But also know when you’re not going to get anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;follow-up&quot;&gt;Follow up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably my number one tip, if they aren’t giving you the answer you would like: Get the operators name and number and agree on a date when it will be resolved. If it hasn’t, ring them up on that date and keep chasing!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing everyone has been saying to me for a long time is ‘you should right a blog about this stuff’, so I finally have. This blog will cover all the money saving advice I can think of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first tip I have is to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://pricehare.com&quot;&gt;Pricehare&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did Pricehare come about? Well I’ve been working on it for a long time now, originally it was just a small script I ran to let me know when the price of a chest of draws I wanted dropped. It was from M&amp;amp;S and I know every 6 weeks or so they run a 20% off promotion for furniture. Usually I would just check the website every day, but I thought why should I do it when I can write a script to check for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One year later, a lot of improvements to the original algorithm and we finally have something we think will be useful to other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope it saves you lots of money!&lt;/p&gt;
