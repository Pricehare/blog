I'm passionate about getting value for money and nothing frustrates me more at the moment than waterproof coats. About a year ago I brought a lovely (expensive) coat from clothing company [howies](http://howies.co.uk) which was labelled 'water resistant' however being out in a downpour it didn't prove resistant at all and leaked. This set me on a mission to find a truly waterproof coat, this highlighted a lot of confusion and mis-direction in the world of waterproofs.

The legal definition of waterproof means that a product needs to have a hydrostatic head greater than 1500 (you can read more about hydrostatic head, what it is and how it works here). However this is just the minimum and I've seen coats go up to 10,000.

Water Resistant
this is where a coat is typically treated with a DWR (durable water repllent) coating. this makes the  water bead on the surface of the coat and works great in light showers but once the cost is covered it can no longer bead and leaks through.

the problem with a dwr coating is that it eventually wears off. ive found this can happen in as little as a few months. ut can be reapplyed using a nikwax wash, though i personally didnt find it helped a lot.
