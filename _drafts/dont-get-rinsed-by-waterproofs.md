I'm passionate about getting value for money and nothing frustrates me more at the moment than waterproof coats. About a year ago I brought a lovely (expensive) coat from clothing comparing [howies](http://howies.co.uk) which was labelled 'water resistant' however being stuck out in a downpour it didn't prove resistant at all and leaked. This set me on a mission to find a truly waterproof coat, and this highlighted a lot of confusion over what the word 'waterproof' actually means and what isn't waterproof.

The legal definition of waterproof means that a product needs to have a hydrostatic head greater than 1500 (you can read more about hydrostatic head, what it is and how it works here). However this is just the minimum and I've seen coats go up to 10,000.
