I'm passionate about getting value for money and nothing frustrates me more at the moment than waterproof coats. About a year ago I brought a lovely (expensive) coat from clothing company [howies](http://howies.co.uk) which was labelled 'water resistant' however being out in regular downpours it didn't prove resistant and leaked constantly. This set me on a mission to find a truly waterproof coat, this highlighted a lot of confusion and mis-direction in the world of waterproofs.

The legal definition of waterproof means that a product needs to have a hydrostatic head greater than 1000 (you can read more about hydrostatic head, what it is and how it works [here](http://www.gearweare.com/guides/camping-guides/what-does-hydrostatic-head-mean/#sthash.8ukdhHJw.dpbs)).

##Water Resistant/Shower Proof
A lot of confusion comes in when manufacturers use the terms _water resistant/shower proof_. This is where a coat is typically treated with a DWR (durable water repellant) coating. The DWR makes the  water bead on the surface of the coat and works great in light showers but once the coat reaches a certain coverage this forces the water to start penitrating the fabric.

The major problem with a DWR coating is that it eventually wears off. I've found this can happen in as little as a few months. It can be reapplyed using a [nikwax wash](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000Q6DKQO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B000Q6DKQO&linkCode=as2&tag=dtsn-21), though this doesn't tend to last as long as the original application.

##Waterproof
