[Bespoke Offers](https://www.bespokeoffers.co.uk) a website with a simple message, enter an item you want and they will find you a lower price.

I thought I would start with a simple product which fluctuates a lot in price, a Yankee Candle. [Christmas Cookie](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Yankee-Candle-Large-Christmas-Cookie/dp/B000C2TB6U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1444660272&sr=8-1&keywords=christmas+cookie+yankee+candle) to be exact. Normally I can get these for around ~£17 on Amazon, but I want to see how cheap Bespoke Offers can make an offer for.

It's a very easy to use interface, much like pricehare. Whereby you enter the URL of the webpage you are looking for and then it will send you an email once they have found you a cheaper price. They aim to find you a cheaper price within 24 to 48 hours.

A merchant from Bespoke offers came back to me within a few hours and offer it for a price of £15 including delivery. While it took a while to get to me, it actually turns out it came from an Amazon Marketplace seller.

Well worth giving it a try.
