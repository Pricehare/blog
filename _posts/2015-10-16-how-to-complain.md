Complaining can seem like a daunting task, it needn't be. If you follow some really simple rules it becomes much easier! Remember if something is not up to your standard then your first port of call is to let the manufacturer know.

### Research

Make sure you've done your research, know your rights who you need to speak to and most importantly what outcome would you like from contacting someone.

### Speak to someone

Always try to speak to someone on the phone, it's a lot more personal and it normally means you can get something resolved quickly.

### Be Nice

Just <strong>be nice</strong> no one wants to be shouted it and it's probably not personally their fault. Try explaining your problem and get the operator to come round to your side of the argument. Explain it slowly and in as much detail as possible.

### Pick your battles

Some items are not worth complaining about, some really are. But also know when you're not going to get anywhere.

### Follow up

This is probably my number one tip, if they aren't giving you the answer you would like: Get the operators name and number and agree on a date when it will be resolved. If it hasn't, ring them up on that date and keep chasing!
