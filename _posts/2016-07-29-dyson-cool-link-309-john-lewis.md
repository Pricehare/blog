title: 'Dyson Cool Link £309 [John Lewis]'
---
We are now in the full swing of summer (though it's raining outside). Today I've tasked myself with finding one of the best fans on the market the Dyson Cool Link Desk Fan for the best price possible.

This fan normally retails at £349, I know, it's a lot for a fan, but as somone who loves things connected to the internet and all the advanced features it has I thought it would be something to invest in.

My default place to buy electrical items from is John Lewis. They have a fantastic gurantee and good customer service when it comes to electricals, however they are normally quite expensive. So i added the Fan to price hare at the start of the week and noticed it hasn't moved. There are some instances when you need to do a bit of research to get the price down.

The secret to John Lewis is there price match, they will price match any high street store. I normally see this as a challange when buying from John Lewis and it normally works. I open up Google product search and start looking for good prices. The trick is the high street store, you need to make sure that any store you put in a pricematch has a high street address, not a warehouse address. A quick look at the 'about us' section on a website and you can see whether it's based on the highstreet.

In this case I found the product at Donaghy Bros based in northen ireland who sell the fan at £304.50. I've personally never heard of them, but John Lewis accepteded the price match and I can pick it up tomorrow with there click and collect service. Perfect for the rainy weekend.

Total amount saved £39.50, amount of time 5 minutes.
