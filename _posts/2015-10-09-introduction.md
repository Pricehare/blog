One thing everyone has been saying to me for a long time is 'you should right a blog about this stuff', so i've finally have. This blog will cover all the money saving advice I can think of.

The first tip I have is to use [Pricehare](http://pricehare.com)!

So how did Pricehare come about? Well i've been working on it for a long time now, originally it was just a small script I run to let me know when the price of a chest of draws went down. It was from M&S and I know ever 6 weeks or so they run a 20% off promotion for furniture. Usually I will just check the website everyday, but I thought why should I do it when I can write a script to check for me.

One year later, a lot of improvements to the original algorithm and we've finally have something we think will be useful to other people.

Hope it saves you lots of money!
